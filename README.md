# Introduction

*This web is still a half-finished product.* <br>
This is a second-hand trading website about "give and buy". The idea came from the fact that people have a lot of unused items, and some of them are exactly what others need. People would sell and buy second-hand products on this side by two main and important features: **Give** and **Find**<br>

This side uses **Neumorphism UI**. <br>

# Discussion

Neumorphism UI is one of the main trends in UI design for 2020 and can be found on dribbble, or Soft UI, a relief-like effect that adds a new form of design to the currently popular flat design, but it is not necessarily the most practical design. Neumorphism is a style that uses the blur, angle and intensity of an object's shadow to highlight the object. Its soft shadows and overall appearance give the design a realistic, futuristic and attractive look. The new anthropomorphism consists of three main elements: 1 background + 2 projections. On top of this, the colour and size parameters are changed to achieve different effects. <br><br>
However, The new anthropomorphism presents the selected state of the buttons beautifully, but the subtle differences between the states of the buttons can be difficult to distinguish for people with visual impairments and for those using devices with poor screen quality or low contrast. The new anthropomorphism distinguishes elements only by soft shadows and lacks contrast, making it less recognisable and less user-friendly for users with low vision, blindness or colour blindness. When users are outdoors, sunlight, screen glare and lack of contrast make use even more compromised, especially for users who are already visually impaired.
